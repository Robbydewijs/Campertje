<h4 id="content-1" class="mt-2">Brand Vision</h4>
			
At Campertje, we believe that camper travel is more than just a way to travel. Our vision is to make camper van life accessible and enjoyable for everyone, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced traveler. By offering educational content and a vibrant community, we aim to inspire and guide people toward unforgettable camper experiences.
			
<br>
<br>
<h4 id="content-2" class="mt-2">Brand Name and Logo</h4>

<img src="images/campertjelogocolor.png" alt="campertjelogo" style="max-width: 650px; height: auto;">
			
<br>
<br>
			
As we wanted to make Campertje approachable for everyone, we used the form of (-tje), which gives the brand a warm and personal feel. It gives a sense of community.
			
<br>
<br>
The shapes and colors were carefully chosen to carry multiple meanings:
<br>
<br>
The Rising Sun <br>
The arches in the logo resemble a rising sun on the horizon – a universal symbol for the start of a new day and new adventures. This perfectly aligns with the feeling of freedom that comes with camper van travel.
<br>
<br>
The Wheel of a Camper (when flipped)<br>
When you flip the logo upside down, it can also be seen as a camper wheel – a symbol of motion, mobility, and the camper itself. This dual meaning reinforces the idea that Campertje is all about being on the road, literally and figuratively.

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
<h4 id="content-3" class="mt-2">Brand Values</h4>

Educational, safety, community driven and adventurous. 

Knowledge makes your journey smoother. Weather it’s the safety rules of your camper van, planning a route, or finding the best camping to stay, we’re here to provide engaging content that helps travelers make informed decisions. Traveling should be adventurous, but never reckless. We educate our community on road safety, emergency preparedness, secure camping spots, and essential travel precautions to ensure a worry-free journey.

<h4 id="content-4" class="mt-2">Visual Identity</h4>

                <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FF7E21;"> </span> #FF7E21 <em>Orange is the heartbeat of Campertje’s visual identity. This vibrant and energetic hue symbolizes adventure, warmth, and enthusiasm, which are central to the experience of van life. It reflects the sunsets seen from a camper’s door, the bonfires with fellow travelers, and the welcoming energy of a community that’s always on the move. But besides all this, it resonates with our target group as it's the national colour of the Netherlands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></li>
                <li>&nbsp;</li>
				<em>Looking at psychological impact, orange evokes excitement and inspries action. It energizes our viewers, making them feel optimistic about their upcoming adventure</em>

              <em>In contrast to the bright and energetic orange, our dark green color brings balance and calmness. Green stands for nature, trust, and peace. It reminds us of the quiet feeling you get when you're parked at a peaceful campsite, surrounded by trees and fresh air. This color reflects the slower, more relaxed way of traveling that camper life offers, and it also shows that Campertje cares about the environment and responsible travel.
			  <li>&nbsp;</li>
			  <em>Green calms and reassures when it comes to physchological impact. It creates the feeling of trust and sustainability, values that are important to modern travelers and Campertje.</em>
			  <li>&nbsp;</li>
			  <em>It therefore underscores Campertje's role as a reliable guide and thoughtful community, supporting its users with curated tips, routes, and a platform that feels safe, grounded, and inspirng.</em>

			<em class="highlight">Museo Sans</em>
			<br>
			 
			<em>We chose Museo Sans because it feels modern, friendly, and easy to read—just like how we want Campertje to feel.

			Its letters are clean and simple, but also a little bit round, which gives them a softer, more welcoming look. This makes the font look professional without being too serious or distant. It helps us show that Campertje is a brand you can trust, but also one that’s fun, relaxed, and made for everyone.

			Museo Sans works well for different types of texts—whether it's for big titles or smaller paragraphs. That makes it a flexible font, perfect for a brand that lives both online and on the road.

			In short, Museo Sans fits perfectly with our community-focused brand: clear, inviting, and full of personality—just like the camper lifestyle.

			<br>  
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
			<em>The website makes usage of several familiar UI patterns that help users feel comfortable and confident when navigating:
			</em>
			<br>
			  <br>
			<em><span class="highlight">Header:</span> The header of the Campertje website is designed to be simple, familiar, and user-friendly, in line with common web navigation patterns. The logo is placed on the left side, which is a standard design convention for easy brand recognition. It also acts as a clickable home button, allowing users to return to the main page from any point on the website.

			To the right, we included a clear and minimal navigation bar with four links: Home, Community, About Us, and Subscribe. The “Subscribe” link is styled as a CTA button, visually standing out and supporting our marketing strategy to build community engagement.

			<br>
			<br>
			<em><span class="highlight">Footer:</span> The footer serves two important purposes: creating a professional finish to the site and connecting users to our social media presence. We included logos of Instagram and Facebook, both of which link directly to our brand pages. These icons are familiar and recognizable.

			The right side of the footer displays the text “Campertje 2025 – All rights reserved,” giving the website a credible and complete look, commonly seen across professional platforms. The footer uses consistent brand colors and layout spacing.

			<br>
			<br>
			<em><span class="highlight">Home Page:</span> Our home page opens with a full-width background video, which immerses users immediately and reflects the adventurous lifestyle we promote. This dynamic background is paired with a motivational slogan—“Never Stop Traveling”—and a short sentence explaining our brand promise. A cta “Explore” button is added to guide users directly into the Community page, keeping the interaction intuitive and action-oriented.

			Right below, a custom hero section further emphasizes our mission, combining a short paragraph, two CTA buttons, and an image of travelers with a camper. This section explains what Campertje is and who it’s for, helping visitors quickly understand our unique value proposition.

			<br>
			<br>
			<em><span class="highlight">Core Values Section:</span> This section breaks down our brand values into four key pillars: Education, Community, Safety, and Adventurousness. Each value is paired with a custom icon and a short explanation. The layout follows a grid, offering a clear and well-balanced visual structure that supports quick scanning.

			By presenting values in this way, we align the content with both user needs and the emotional tone of the brand. It helps users connect with our personality and see what makes Campertje more than just a travel platform as it’s a community-first brand.

			<br>
			<br>
			<em><span class="highlight">News Section &amp; Blogs Section:</span> The News and Blogs section uses a card-based layout. Each card includes an image, a short text preview, and a “Read More” CTA. This allows users to quickly preview articles and click through if they’re interested.

			This structure supports a content marketing strategy, where informative blog posts provide real value to users. Topics like checklists, must-visit places, and camper tips make the website feel both practical and inspiring, reinforcing Campertje’s position as a reliable travel companion. On our homepage you'll see a preview of 3 blogs, while on our community page your able to view every blog.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
				
			<br>
			<br>
			<em><span class="highlight">Contact Form:</span> At the bottom of every&nbsp; page, we included a Contact Us form to encourage communication between visitors and the Campertje team. The form includes fields for name, address, phone number, and a message box, plus a date picker. This reflects our user-centered design approach, giving visitors a clear and easy way to reach out without ambiguity.

			This promotes trust and signals that we are open, responsive, and community-oriented. <br>
			<br>
			<em><span class="highlight">About Us:</span> The About Us page provides context and personality. It begins with a split section: “Who is Campertje?” and “Why Campertje?” These are positioned side-by-side, offering a clear layout that helps users understand both the origin and mission of the brand at a glance.
			<br>
			<br>
			The use of the dark green background creates visual separation from the rest of the site, helping this section stand out while reinforcing the brand’s grounded, nature-focused color scheme.
			<br>
			<br>
			Below, the Core Values are repeated intentionally. This repetition reinforces the brands consistency across different parts of the site and serves as a visual anchor.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Meet the Team section uses clean profile cards with rounded edges and subtle shadows—design choices that create a friendly and modern aesthetic. It adds a human face to the brand, helping build trust, which is especially important in community-based platforms.
            </em>
				
			<br>
			<br>
			<em><span class="highlight">Subscription Page:</span> The Subscription page is short, clear, and focused—exactly what a call-to-action page should be. The content explains the benefits of subscribing in a simple bullet-point list, which is easy to scan and highlights the value quickly.

			The “Subscribe Now” button has the orange brand color, which  stands out visually.

			  <li> <strong>Our Testing Protocol</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>We start off by explaining what the test is about and what we're trying to gain from this test. This is about testing the website to see if people get what Campertje is trying to do. We must inspect the site to assess its usability and identify areas for improvement.</li>
                <li>We then start off by introducing our test person and ask them a couple of general questions  such as, Do you have a camper van? Do you look online for camper tips or content? Do you share your trip experience with others?</li>
                <li>Task 1: Have a look at our homepage for 1 minute and see if you can tell what the website is exactly for and what it wants to bring to you as a consumer.
			    </li>
				<li>Task 2: Try to find the tips or trip ideas that are shared by others through blogs. If found, tell us if you would use this and why or why not.</li>
              </ul>
				  
<li> <strong>What we look for during the test</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>While testing, we have looked at the 5 E's of usability, which are: Is the product effective? Is it efficient? Is it engaging? Is it error-tolerant? Is it easy to learn? </li>
                <li>We then start off by introducing our test person and ask them a couple of general questions  such as, Do you have a camper van? Do you look online for camper tips or content? Do you share your trip experience with others?</li>
                <li>Task 1: Have a look at our homepage for 1 minute and see if you can tell what the website is exactly for and what it wants to bring to you as a consumer.

			 	  <br>
				  <br>
				  
<li><strong>Testing Results</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>After doing the tests, we've noticed that the interface of our website was pretty intuitive and that the content was easy to understand. Most of the test participants knew what Campertje was about after looking at the home page for a minute.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </li>
                <li>The first area of improvement would be the blog detail view: where users need a clearer way of returning to the previous page with articles. What we could consider is adding breadcrumbs or have a clearer internal navigation within the community section and the blogs.</li>
                <li>The second area of improvement would be to improve the visibility and distinction of user-shared-content. Labeling sections more clearly (e.g., "Community Posts" or "User Stories"). We could consider adding usernames or interaction features to enhance the community engagement.
			    </li>
				<br>
				<li>The testing confirmed that Campertje’s website has an intuitive interface and clearly communicates its purpose to new visitors. However, two key areas for improvement emerged: enhancing navigation within the blog section and better distinguishing user-generated content. Addressing these areas through clearer labeling, better navigation linking, and interactive features could significantly improve overall user experience and community engagement. </li>

<h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>

<p>We are Campertje! A community-based platform where Dutch camper van lovers can share their tips and trips. Whether you are looking for a picturesque camping spot in nature or a handy solution for your overweight van, at Campertje, it is all about connection, safety and convenience on the road. In this section on marketing, we outline our marketing campaign and explain how we aim to create awareness for this platform.
</p>

<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Campaign context and promotional activities</h4>

<p>The campaign is focused on positioning Campertje as a strong brand within the Dutch camper van community. We aim to raise awareness about the platform and encourage community engagement through social media and our website.</p>

<p><strong>What did we do?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Publishing reels and informative posts on Instagram and Facebook</li>
  <li>Stories and polls to increase engagement</li>
  <li>Referring to the upcoming landing page of the website, where readers can read more about the topic of the post</li>
</ul>

<p>On Instagram, we mainly focus on sharing informative posts and giving the viewer teasers of the blogs we upload on the website. We uploaded on Wednesday and Sunday at 12:00h lunchtime.
</p>

<p>We decided on this time, since our target audience mentioned in the interviews that they are mostly active on social media between 12 and 1 p.m. Furthermore, Wednesday is a typical break moment, and Sunday is ideal to inspire people with new plans or ideas for the upcoming week.
</p>

<p>For the post design, we tried to work within the frames of our style guide: orange and green as main colours, with a minimalistic and professional feel. All visual content fits the values of Campertje: awareness, safety and connection.
</p>

<h4>Objectives</h4>

<p>All the campaign decisions that we made were based on our measurable goals tied to the planning and communication plan. The goal is to create more traffic to the website, where visitors can find blogs with more explanation about the social media posts and to build up a community within our target audience.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reach objective:</strong> By the 1st of May, the following objectives should be reached:
    <ul>
      <li>100 social media interactions (likes, comments, shares) on Instagram and Facebook combined.</li>
      <li>At least 5 comments under posts on both platforms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Affect objective:</strong> Creating a sense of community within our target audience, where users are stimulated to respond actively, share their experience and to participate in discussions about camper trips and safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Response objective:</strong> By the 1st of May, we expect to achieve:
    <ul>
      <li>To gain 100 followers in total on Instagram and Facebook in total.</li>
      <li>An increase in traffic towards the website, where visitors can read in-depth blogs that are linked to the social media posts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

	<!-- ========================== -->
<!-- DEEL 2: Doelgroep & Kanalen -->
<!-- ========================== -->

<h4>Channels/Platforms</h4>

<p>For the execution of Campertje’s marketing campaign, we chose Facebook and Instagram as primary platforms. This decision fits the social media habits of our target audience and is supported through our research in the interviews and existing research.
</p>

<p>Facebook and Instagram are still belonging to the biggest social media platforms worldwide (Statista, 2024). Facebook offers many possibilities for building communities and interaction, while Instagram excels in visual storytelling and fast interaction. These insights fit perfectly with the vision that we want to convey throughout the marketing campaign of Campertje.</p>

<h4>Clarification</h4>

<p>Our target audience consists of Dutch camper van users in the age category between 25 to 60 years. We can separate this into two subsegments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The older target audience (35-60 years) is very active on Facebook, particularly through community interactions, group activities and sharing their personal experiences.</li>
  <li>The younger target audience (25-35 years) intensively uses Instagram for visual inspiration, short-form content and stories about travelling and outdoor lifestyle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research shows that 70% of the Dutch Facebook users are active daily (Newcom, 2024). Furthermore, Instagram users spend 2 to 3 hours daily on the platform on average, whereby visual content such as reels and stories is mostly consumed.</p>

<h4>Interview social media insights</h4>

<p>In addition, we asked questions regarding social media usage to our camper van users that we interviewed. They gave us the following insights about their social media behaviour:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The most used media platforms within our interviews were Facebook and Instagram (respectively 89% and 76% of the interviewees).</li>
  <li>The peak hours of social media consumption are in the evening (between 18:00 and 22:00).</li>
  <li>The most important reason to consume social media is to get inspired and exchange experiences with others.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Based on the existing market research and our interview insights about social media, we decided to use Facebook and Instagram as the main platforms for our campaign. Both channels offer exactly the tools that are required to generate traffic to the website and create an active community within our target audience.</p>

<h5>Reflection</h5>
<p>
During the marketing campaign for Campertje, we learned a lot about planning, execution and adapting the social media strategy. You can find a reflection based on our communication &amp; marketing plan goals below.
</p>

<h5>Week 1</h5>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Statistic</th>
      <th>Instagram</th>
      <th>Facebook</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Views</td>
      <td>1,200</td>
      <td>320</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reach</td>
      <td>500</td>
      <td>80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interactions</td>
      <td>40</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of posts</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
In the first week, we focused on creating awareness around our new brand and social media accounts. The first post was an introduction about the platform and scored exceptionally well with 1,100 views, since we also promoted it on our private Instagram accounts. The start was promising, especially because we reached a lot of new accounts that increased our reach very fast.
</p>

<h5>Week 2</h5>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Statistic</th>
      <th>Instagram</th>
      <th>Facebook</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Views</td>
      <td>500</td>
      <td>280</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reach</td>
      <td>250</td>
      <td>65</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interactions</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of posts</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<p>
In the second week, the number of views continued to increase significantly. The content was about tips and camper <a href="#">lifehacks</a>. Unfortunately, we faced a decline in the amount of interaction, but it also showed that carousel posts were very effective. Also, the reels gained less interaction than we hoped and expected.
</p>

<h5>Week 3</h5>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Statistic</th>
      <th>Instagram</th>
      <th>Facebook</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Views</td>
      <td>300</td>
      <td>180</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reach</td>
      <td>150</td>
      <td>45</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interactions</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of posts</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<p>
During the third week, we noticed a small decrease in reach and interaction. This was possibly because there was less publicity via stories since we mainly focused on posts. We tried to adjust our variety in types of posts to create more visibility.
</p>

<h5>Week 4</h5>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Statistic</th>
      <th>Instagram</th>
      <th>Facebook</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Views</td>
      <td>221</td>
      <td>103</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reach</td>
      <td>108</td>
      <td>26</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interactions</td>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of posts</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
In the final days of our campaign, we noticed an increase in interactions and views. We posted about camperlife essentials and IKEA hacks, and it showed that it hit well with our target audience.
</p>

<h5>What went well?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Posting around 12:00 on Instagram and 19:00 on Facebook seemed effective, according to the high activity of followers in these periods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Carousel posts (posts with multiple slides) had the best performance and led to more engagement in comparison with the other types of posts.
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>56.7% of the views came from non-followers, which means that we were able to reach new people with our content.</li>
</ul>

<h5>What went less well?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Despite the use of reels, the interaction was lower than we expected beforehand (32.2% of all interactions).</li>
  <li>We did not focus on the use of stories (6.9% of the views), and it seems like a missed opportunity for increasing fast interactions with the target audience.</li>
</ul>

<h5>What can we improve?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>We can try to deploy better interactive questions to provoke more comments under our posts.</li>
  <li>Deploying stories daily, for example, with small polls, quizzes or behind the scenes to gain more interactions.</li>
  <li>Varying in post times to experiment which time is the most optimal to post.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>
The Campertje campaign was effective enough to meet our goals and start up a community. We gained a lot of useful insights to improve our future planning and make it fit more to the needs and wants of our target audience. We succeeded in making a foundation for further growth and depth of our community.
</p>

<h5>Takeaways</h5>
<p>
During the Campertje marketing campaign, we gained several important insights that will help us further improve our marketing activities in the future.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important lessons was that building a real community takes more time and continuous interaction than we expected. Although we post regularly, building engagement is still a process that requires more stimulation. In the future, we could focus more actively on provoking discussions and inviting users to share their personal camper experiences.
</p>
<p>
It also turned out that static carousel posts (with multiple slides) performed better than expected, while reels, despite their general popularity, generated less interaction within our specific target group. This showed that our target group values practical tips and authentic content more than quick, trend-oriented videos.
</p>

<p>
We also learned that the time of posting played a bigger role than we had anticipated. Posting on Instagram around 12:00 and on Facebook around 19:00 matched the peak activity of our target group well, according to the interviews and statistics.
</p>

<p>
We also noticed that Facebook requires a different communication style than Instagram. Posts with more text and explanation performed better on Facebook, while Instagram responded better to visual and shorter updates.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we discovered that hashtags are only effective if they are truly relevant and target group-oriented. General hashtags hardly contributed to additional reach; niche hashtags, specifically aimed at camper life, did generate new viewers.
</p>

<p>
During the Campertje marketing campaign, we gained several important insights that will help us further improve our marketing activities in the future.
</p>

<!-- DEEL 4: Future Planning & Professionalism -->
<!-- ========================== -->

<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future planning</h4>

<p>
If the marketing project for Campertje were to be continued, several points for improvement could be implemented based on the insights gained.
</p>

<p>
The target group does not need to be changed. The focus on Dutch camper users between 25 and 60 years of age fits in perfectly with Campertje’s vision. However, we do recommend further in-depth research into their online behaviour, in particular into which type of content generates the most interaction and at what times they are most active. We already know that visual inspiration and practical tips work well, but more insight into the preferences for content formats (for example, short videos versus carousel posts) can further increase effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
Another point for improvement is the communication and media plan. During the first campaign period, an average of four posts per week were posted across Instagram and Facebook. Although this provided a good basis, the frequency could be increased in a follow-up campaign. Social media platforms themselves advise posting more often for greater reach and higher engagement.
</p>

<p>
A realistic goal would be to post four to five posts per week per channel, supplemented with regular stories to remain visible on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
In addition, we should use more interactive content, such as polls, quizzes and short questions in posts. This contributes to higher involvement and stimulates the community building that is central to Campertje.
</p>

<p>
It is also an option to conduct a competition (for example, “win a camper travel kit” or “share your most beautiful camper spot and win a prize”). This can be a good method to quickly increase both reach and interaction.
</p>

<p>
Finally, another point for improvement is to apply variation in content types even more consciously: alternate between inspiring photos, short videos, carousels, tips and personal stories. On Facebook, a little more emphasis can be placed on extensive posts with more text, while on Instagram, the visual experience remains central.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, we advise setting new measurable objectives for the next campaign phase, so that we can build in clear evaluation moments and make adjustments where necessary.
</p>


<h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>

<p>
During the campaign, we tried to stick to the style of the Campertje brand as much as possible. Think of fixed colours (orange and green), a calm and minimalistic layout and photos that fit the camper life. In our posts and stories, we mainly wanted to convey the atmosphere of freedom, safety and ease while travelling.
</p>

<p>
We wrote the texts under the posts (the captions) in an accessible style, so that it fits our target group. We regularly used emojis such as ✅, 🔧 or 🧡 to make things clearer or to add some extra atmosphere. This made the posts less boring and ensured that the most important tips stood out more quickly. This tone worked well because it matched how our target group communicates on Instagram and Facebook.
</p>

<p>
What was not yet completely consistent was the difference between the Reels and the regular posts. The regular posts all had the same style and use of colour, but with the Reels, this was less clear. There was no fixed layout or recognisable form in it yet, which made it feel less like “Campertje”. That is something we would like to tackle better in the next campaign. For example, by also creating a fixed template for Reels.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, in the beginning, we created a few posts that were not yet completely in line with the rest of the feed, because the style guide was not yet finished. But from week 2, this improved, and the posts started to look more and more like a whole.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the style of Campertje is now good, but there is still room to extend the visual line to all formats, such as Reels. We also want to pay more attention to recognizability in every piece of content.
</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">Takeaways &amp; Lessons learned</h4>

<p>Summarising our campaign, we can conclude that it’s very important to create consistency in your content planning, especially when working with algorithms. After week 1 and 2, we noticed a decrease in reach and engagement due to fewer uploads and less variation. Our biggest lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carousel posts worked best and generated the most engagement.</li>
  <li>Stories were underused — something we would fix by including them in our weekly schedule.</li>
  <li>Personal content (e.g. IKEA hacks, relatable camper topics) got most shares and comments.</li>
  <li>Reels did not perform well, partly due to lack of visual consistency and editing style.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also learned how important it is to start strong with a launch post that gets promoted by your network. That first boost is key for the algorithm to pick up your content and recommend it to others. After that, consistency and interaction are what keep your reach stable.</p>

<p>These statistics were retrieved from Instagram and Facebook insights available to the Campertje account during the campaign.

However, we see clear growth in brand awareness and page activity.</p>

<h5>Problem</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The overweight issue with campervans:</strong> Many campervans exceed legal weight limits, which reduces fuel efficiency, increases wear and tear, and can lead to fines.</li>
  <li><strong>Campervans too large for narrow roads:</strong> Concerns about road safety and route suitability. Traditional motorhomes struggle on narrow European roads and in remote locations, limiting accessibility.</li>
  <li><strong>No nearby repair services or technical support:</strong> When traveling, campervan users may not have access to garages, services, or technical help.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource management:</strong> Locating facilities for waste disposal and water replenishment is often a significant concern for travellers.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Because of these reasons, Campertje has developed a solution to address the challenges that travellers face on their adventures.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing consumers with educational advice and resources: Offer guides, tutorials (for operation and maintenance), a digital checklist (covering packing, setup, safety, and troubleshooting), and offer help to users.</li>
  <li>Service Network: Establish partnerships with campsites and service providers, including a map of certified camper garages and support points.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Customer segments</h5>
<p>Target audience: our camper lovers, aged 26-68. Those who are more financially stable and interested in sustainable travel. Families traveling with children or older adults. Values that drive out in adventures, education, community, and safety. However, there are also new campervan owners seeking guidance and community support.</p>

<h5>Unique value proposition</h5>
<p>Campertje has three key value propositions that make their brand and website unique:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All-in-one platform:</strong> For everything you need to know or want while traveling with your campervan.</li>
  <li><strong>Community engagement:</strong> We foster a supportive community where campers can share experiences, tips, and solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Sustainable implementation:</strong> Promoting eco-friendly practices and solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Unfair advantage</h5>
<p>We also have some unfair advantages, stemming from being community-driven (organic growth through user-generated content), our brand loyalty (strong engagement built on trust and a consistent user experience), and the integration of local stories and real-time tips (available on our website and social media).</p>

<h5>Channels</h5>
<p>After conducting thorough research on our target audience, we determined that these three channels would be the best fit for Campertje. The use of social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. Partnerships with campsites and repair services, along with our own website, serve as the central hub for services and community engagement.</p>

<h5>Key metrics</h5>

  <li>The subscribed members: The number of people who have subscribed to our membership on the website.</li>
  <li>Community feedback: Analyze user feedback to enhance offerings, such as emergency services and garage locator usage.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Revenue streams</h5>
<p>Campertje mainly wants to generate revenue from subscription services. Where customers get a premium membership with exclusive content and perks. Such as additional educational advice and resources, including guides, tutorials, digital checklists, and service networks. We offer a subscription price of €35 per month, payable on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>After further research, we also found that advertising with partner promotions and targeted ads would give us €1000 per month. We knew that having our subscription on average with other subscription offers was the best match with the other earnings from advertising.</p>

<p><strong>Yearly calculation:</strong>  
Campertjes’ yearly revenue stream would be generated through our membership, which costs €35 per month, with an average of 250 people invested in our website due to brand loyalty. Additionally, our advertising generates €1000 per month.  
<em>Estimated revenue:</em> (35 × 250 + 1000) × 12 = €117,000 yearly earnings</p>

<h5>Cost structure</h5>
<p>Campertje’s average costs would be made from marketing, web design, research, and development:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> The average salary for marketing is €5101 per month (for the paid social media ads and content marketing).</li>
  <li><strong>Web design:</strong> €229 per month.</li>
  <li><strong>Research and development:</strong> The average salary is €1000 per month (for improving platform features and user experience).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total:</strong>  
Monthly costs: €6,330  
Yearly costs: €6,330 × 12 = €75,960</p>

<!-- MANAGEMENT – Validatie & Appendix -->
<!-- ========================== -->

<h4 id="management-5" class="mt-2">Validation of assumptions</h4>

<p>Before conducting our problem interviews, our assumptions about Campertje were primarily based on online travel blogs, where campervan users often discussed difficulties, such as booking and managing trips, finding accurate information for campsites, and limited support.  We thought camper lovers needed direction, helpful tools, and community support.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Throughout the interviews, we identified two key problems: the overweight of the campervan and resource management. Secondly, there are crucial concerns about campers on minor roads, which limit accessibility to remote locations. While we initially thought common tips would be sufficient, the interview feedback revealed a strong demand for specific tutorials, real-time help services, and personalized engagement within a community. We pivoted from a simple content platform to a multipurpose solution that offers video tutorials, checklists on topics such as safety and service networks, and a toolkit for asking for help and sharing experiences within the community. The solution interviews confirmed that users are enthusiastic about these tools and appreciate our focus on sharing educational resources, safety information, and support. A key point was shifting from passive content to more engaging content, supported by a network. Helping campervan lovers feel secure and connected within their adventures. 
</li>
  <li>In our research on other compared alternatives, such as Facebook groups, Campertje fills a clear space by offering an all-in-one platform with integrated, camper-specific resources that are more than just casual conversations, providing reliable help along the way. 
</li>
